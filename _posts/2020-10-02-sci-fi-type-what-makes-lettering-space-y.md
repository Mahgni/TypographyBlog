If you were to imagine a typeface from the distant future, what would it look like? Would we marvel at its brilliance or question its otherworldliness? Would typefaces even still be relevant forms of design? Graphic designers were faced with these questions when sci-fi culture began to take off in the early 70s; directors and authors needed a style that, at a glance could let the viewer know that the media with which the type was emblazoned upon fell into the science-fiction genre. 

'Sci-Fi' style typefaces are especially interesting since they often depict the design languages that they imagine becoming prevalent in the future, making them interesting snapshots into what direction artists and designers believes their industries were going at the time of the typefaces creation.

A good example of this design mindset comes in the form of the *Computerfont* typeface that was prevelant thoughout the seventies not just in sci-fi media, but in anything that wanted to appear futuristic and up-to-date... most notably mathmatics text books.

*Computerfont* is defined by its sharp increases and decreases in contrast. I believe this was originally done to make the font appear visually distinctive on the primitive screens of the time by having clear protrusions that could be displayed more easily on low resolution screens. This design choice may have also stemmed from the desire to create a visually appealing typeface that would be completely computer-centric which, at the time, would have been a reasonable decision due to the rapidly growing personal computer market. 

Another typeface that is still prominent today would be that created for the Star Wars movie's branding. Although this typeface was never officialy named or released, several design studios have faithfully recreated it, a prominent example being *[Star Jedi](https://www.fontspace.com/star-jedi-font-f9641)* created by Boba Fonts.

This typeface achieves a sleek, futuristic look that, arguably unlike *Computerfont*, still holds up in 2020. Thick, clear lettering combined with the occasionsal bold, modern serifs and a monospaced design exellently encapsulate the galaxy-at-war style aesthetic that George Lucas was creating the Star Wars universe. In the iconic Star Wars logo, the text is also transparent with a bright yellow highlight, giving the already futuristic typeface a sci-fi twist.
