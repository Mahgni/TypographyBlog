If you were to imagine a typeface from the distant future, what would it look like? Would we marvel at its brilliance or question its otherworldliness? Would typefaces even still be relevant forms of design? Graphic designers were faced with these questions when sci-fi culture began to take off in the early 70s; directors and authors needed a style that, at a glance could let the viewer know that the media with which the type was emblazoned upon fell into the science-fiction genre. 

'Sci-Fi' style typefaces are especially interesting since they often depict the design languages that they imagine becoming prevalent in the future, making them interesting snapshots into what direction artists and designers believes their industries were going at the time of the typefaces creation.

A good example of this design mindset comes in the form of the Computerfont typeface that was prevelant thoughout the seventies not just in sci-fi media, but in anything that wanted to appear futuristic and up-to-date... most notably mathmatics text books.
