The world of motorsport is, much like its cars, fast, flowing and constantly evolving to reach new limits and push evermore distant boundaries. It comes as no surprise then that its design ethic aims to echo these values as much as possible, incorporating both the emotional, traditional aspects of the sport as well as its cutting-edge technology and commitment to constant and ruthless advancement.

This complex blend of emotions and priorities bleed into all aspects of motorsport design. From the team-wear to the circuit advertisements to the liveries on the cars, bright colours and bold branding are never in short supply. 

So what of the typeface? Well, in the case of the premiere world motorsports category, Formula 1, the current typeface is known simply as *F1 Regular* with a wider, more extreme version called *F1 Turbo* and a clear bold branding font known as *F1 Torque.*

This typeface was introduced in 2017 and aims, when used in tandem, to mimic the design of a top-down track map by incorporating a blend of smooth curves and sharp angles to create a highly modern sans-serif design. Straight lines are at the heart of the type with letters like 'a' and 'c' incorporating them into what would otherwise be a more gentle curve on a conventional typeface. While smooth curves are prioritised where required, sharp corners are introduced to prevent the font from becoming too flowing and loosing its exciting, precise edge that is at the heart of the Formula 1 philosophy.
