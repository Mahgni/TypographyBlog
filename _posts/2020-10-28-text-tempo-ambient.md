How do you visually portray a genre of music that often doesn't have vocals, uses mostly computerised sounds and sometimes doesn't even have a beat? 

Ambient music began to grow in popularity in the mid-to-late 90s with techniques like tape looping and has continued to grow until this day with evolution and fusion genres like lo-fi hiphop achieving massive success. 

From a design perspective, ambient music has naturally adopted the design traits of its sound, alongside a modern and often highly minimalist aesthetic. 

A good example of this would be Andrew Huang's 2017 album, *The Lyres in Trees.*

This aesthetic is the most common interpretation of ambient music throughout the genre; clean, minimalist and often natural imagery with little stylisation or extra visual noise. 

This style translates into the typeface as well, primarily using bold, sans serif fonts and white lettering on a darker background. Text's inclusion is often minimal with very small lettering being used for the essential details which adds to the relaxing atmosphere the music is trying to create; the music itself isn't bold so why should the typography be? 

This minimalism can be taken to extreme lengths as seen in the design of the album *Forever Hum* by Cory Allen.

This art boils down the ambient style to its barest form, removing text entirely and focusing on a single combination of colours to achieve an atmosphere of calm and serenity, a perfect match for the sound of the album.
