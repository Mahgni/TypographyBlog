How do you visually portray a genre of music that often doesn't have vocals, uses mostly computerised sounds and sometimes doesn't even have a beat? 

Ambient music began to grow in popularity in the mid-to-late 90s with techniques like tape looping and has continued to grow until this day with evolution and fusion genres like lo-fi hiphop achieving massive success.
