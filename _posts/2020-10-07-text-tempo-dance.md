Few music genres state their intentions explicitly though their names... with one significant exception. Dance music is entirely focused on making the listener move; pump up clubs and rattle car sound systems with its heavy 4/4 bass lines and dramatic, feel-good synth melodies. 

Dance music has some of the most energetic and stylised design ethics within the music industry, placing focus on both the energy of the music and the euphoric atmosphere that it aims to produce. 

Modern, sans-serif, thick lettering is often at the heart of dance music's visual design, often being paired with colourful and energetic imagery.

However, dance music is an incredibly vast genre that covers a multitude of different styles and influences from other genres. Design elements not dissimilar from rock and metal can be seen in the logos and branding typography of Sonny 'Skrillex' Moore and DJ duo Krewella.
