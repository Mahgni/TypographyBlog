BREAKTEXT aims to create a hub for content on, and examples of, interesting and useful forms of typography and its usage in the modern world. We cover topics from every corner of society to get the broadest, most inclusive view of the modern world of type. 

My name is Seb Ingham, I'm from Oxford and I'm the main contributor to the BREAKTEXT project. I'm a student at Oxford Brookes University currently in my second year of my bachelors degree in Media, Publishing and Journalism.
