BREAKTEXT aims to create a hub for content on, and examples of, interesting and useful forms of typography and its usage in the modern world. 

We cover topics from every corner of society to get the broadest, most inclusive view of the modern world of type. 

**Logo**

![The BREAKTEXT Logo.](../uploads/btfavicon.png "The BREAKTEXT Logo.")

My logo is centred around the idea and usage of negative space to create a smooth yet striking typographical image. Helvetica Bold Oblique was used for the baseline of the design due to its clean, modern aesthetic. 

The extremities of the letters were then stretched outside of the background to create unbroken areas of negative space, representing the text breaking from the traditional mould.

A dark gray background was chosen to prevent the logo from clashing with whatever media it is emblazoned on since the world of typography is often colourful and vibrant.
